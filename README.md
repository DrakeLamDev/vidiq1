# HOW TO CRACK THIS YOURSELF

I will show you how to crack VidIQ to get Pro features. 

Step 1 :

Install the VidIQ from the Chrome Store and
Go to chrome's extension folder.
Its at : C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions

Step 2:
Locate the VidIQ folder !
For me it was pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl

Step 3:
Inside that folder, open the folder with Version Code. of VidIQ
For me it was : 2.42.6_0

Step 4:
You will find bundle.js inside it. Open it with notepad++.
Note : If you haven't installed it, search in the google and install it.

Step 5:
Press Ctrl + F (Find)
They type " t=e[0] "

Step 6:
Change that into : 
t=e[1] for pro
t=e[2] for boost lite
t=e[3] for boost
t=e[4] for boost plus
t=e[5] for enterprise

Note : For me enterprise doesn't work well so I choose boost plus !

Step 7:
Save that as bundle.js on Desktop !

Step 8:
Copy the extension folder to the desktop ! ie.pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl

Step 9:
Delete the "bundle.js" file and "_metadata" folder which is already inside the extension folder at Desktop and copy the bundle.js that we just made.

Step 10:
Go to chrome extension page ! ie. chrome://extensions/

Step 11:
Uninstall the VidIQ plugin !

Turn on the Developer Mode !

Click "Load unpacked extension". Then choose the extension folder at desktop.
